CS50 Problem set

Specification

Write, in a file called mario.c in your ~/workspace/pset1 directory, a program that recreates these half-pyramids using hashes (#) for blocks.

To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramids' heights, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. (The height of the half-pyramids pictured above happens to be 4, the width of each half-pyramid 4, with an a gap of size 2 separating them.)

If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, you should re-prompt for the same again.

Then, generate (with the help of printf and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramids.

Take care to left-align the bottom-left corner of the left-hand half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
